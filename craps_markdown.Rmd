## Code explanation

The code I selected was from a learning R repository on: https://github.com/josephpconley/R/blob/master/craps.R


This is a game of two dice where you can win if the sum of both dice are 7 or 11 .It rolls a dice twice using the `sample` function from 1 to 6. Then check the sum of of the two numbers and if it is  7 ir 11 it save it in the wins vector. Finally it just sum the number of wins.
```{r}
wins <- rep(0,1000)
for(i in 1:1000){
  #roll dice
  d <- sample(1:6, 2, replace=T)

  #shooter wins in Come Out
  if(sum(d) == 7 || sum(d) == 11) wins[i] <- 1
}
sum(wins)
```
